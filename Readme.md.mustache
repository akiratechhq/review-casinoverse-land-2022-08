## Executive summary

This report represents the results of the engagement with **{{client_name}}** to review **{{project_name}}**.

The review was conducted over the course of **{{review_period}}** from **{{date_interval}}**. A total of **{{person_days}} person-days** were spent reviewing the code.

### Week 1

### Week 2

The second week was ...

## Scope

The initial review focused on the [{{project_name}}]({{source_repository}}) repository, identified by the commit hash `{{commit_hash}}`.

We focused on manually reviewing the codebase, searching for security issues such as, but not limited to, re-entrancy problems, transaction ordering, block timestamp dependency, exception handling, call stack depth limitation, integer overflow/underflow, self-destructible contracts, unsecured balance, use of origin, costly gas patterns, architectural problems, code readability.

**Includes:**
- code/contracts/Land.sol


## Recommendations

We identified a few possible general improvements that are not security issues during the review, which will bring value to the developers and the community reviewing and using the product.

### Increase the number of tests

A good rule of thumb is to have 100% test coverage. This does not guarantee the lack of security problems, but it means that the desired functionality behaves as intended. The negative tests also bring a lot of value because not allowing some actions to happen is also part of the desired behavior.
