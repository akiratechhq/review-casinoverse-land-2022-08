## Executive summary

This report represents the results of the engagement with **Casino Metaverse** to review **Casinoverse Land**.

The review was conducted over the course of **1 week** from **August the 1st to August the 5th, 2022**. A total of **5 person-days** were spent reviewing the code.

### Week 1

During the first week, we 

- review code and start drafting some initial issues
- create a Fisher Yates proof of concept
- set up a meeting to discuss the issues
- work on the report
- present report

## Scope

The initial review focused on the [Casinoverse Land](git@github.com:casinometaverse/casinoverse-land.git) repository, identified by the commit hash `bf607afe5ff68b91990649567347f333bb27f6be`.

We focused on manually reviewing the codebase, searching for security issues such as, but not limited to, re-entrancy problems, transaction ordering, block timestamp dependency, exception handling, call stack depth limitation, integer overflow/underflow, self-destructible contracts, unsecured balance, use of origin, costly gas patterns, architectural problems, code readability.

**Includes:**
- code/contracts/Land.sol


## Recommendations

We identified a few possible general improvements that are not security issues during the review, which will bring value to the developers and the community reviewing and using the product.

### Increase the number of tests

A good rule of thumb is to have 100% test coverage. This does not guarantee the lack of security problems, but it means that the desired functionality behaves as intended. The negative tests also bring a lot of value because not allowing some actions to happen is also part of the desired behavior.

## Issues


### [Whitelisted addresses can mint more than `maxMintPerAddress`](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/issues/4)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Major](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Major&color=ff3b30&style=flat-square)

**Description**

A user can call the method `batchMint` to mint a group of tokens. This method enforces a maximum number of tokens per whitelisted address using the modifier `isNFTBalanceExceedsMaxMintPerAddress`:


[code/contracts/Land.sol#L419-L432](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/blob/0c7e33d79303b0e0278aa10943580119b08c8778/code/contracts/Land.sol#L419-L432)
```solidity
    function batchMint(
        uint256[] calldata _tokenIds,
        string[] calldata _tokenURIs,
        bytes32[] memory _merkleProof
    )
        external
        payable
        whenNotPaused
        isCallerValid
        isTotalMintedExceedsMaxSupply(_tokenIds.length)
        isValidAmount(_tokenIds.length)
        isNFTBalanceExceedsMaxMintPerAddress(msg.sender, _tokenIds.length)
        isWhitelisted(_merkleProof)
    {
```

Each user is allowed to mint up to a maximum number of tokens defined as `maxMintPerAddress` as enforced by the modifier `isNFTBalanceExceedsMaxMintPerAddress`:


[code/contracts/Land.sol#L308-L321](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/blob/0c7e33d79303b0e0278aa10943580119b08c8778/code/contracts/Land.sol#L308-L321)
```solidity
    /**
    * @dev Throws if caller balance + amount of nft to mint 
    *      exceeds maxMintPerAddress
    *
    * @param _address address of minter
    * @param _nftQty amount of nft to mint
    */
    modifier isNFTBalanceExceedsMaxMintPerAddress(address _address, uint256 _nftQty) {
        require(
            (balanceOf(_address) + _nftQty) <= maxMintPerAddress,
            "Max nft per address reached"
        );
        _;
    }
```

This modifier is added to both methods that mint tokens `batchMint` and `mint`.

However, the check uses the user's current balance, not how many tokens they minted. The user's balance can be modified by sending the tokens to a different address and calling `batchmintMint` again, minting up to `maxMintPerAddress`. The user can send the tokens to a different address and repeat the process.

**Recommendation**

Use a mapping that counts how many tokens were minted for each address. This way, the user has no option to decrease the number used when making the verification in `isNFTBalanceExceedsMaxMintPerAddress`.

A suggestion is to use the current modifier `isNFTBalanceExceedsMaxMintPerAddress` to increase the count and do the check.

```solidity

// Define a mapping that counts how many tokens were minted per whitelisted address
mapping(address => uint256) mintedTokensPerWhitelistedAddress;

modifier isNFTBalanceExceedsMaxMintPerAddress(address _address, uint256 _nftQty) {
	// Increment the number of minted tokens
    mintedTokensPerWhitelistedAddress[_address] += _nftQty;

	// Check if the total number of minted tokens is allowed
    require(
        mintedTokensPerWhitelistedAddress[_address] <= maxMintPerAddress,
        "Max nft per address reached"
    );
    _;
}

```

### [Modifier `isValidAmount` should check for strict equality](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/issues/7)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Medium&color=FF9500&style=flat-square)

**Description**

When a user calls the methods `mint` or `batchMint`, they need to provide the correct amount of ether in order to buy the tokens. The ether amount is checked in the modifier `isValidAmount`.


[code/contracts/Land.sol#L239-L247](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/blob/0c7e33d79303b0e0278aa10943580119b08c8778/code/contracts/Land.sol#L239-L247)
```solidity
    /**
    * @dev Throws if amount is not enough
    *
    * @param _nftQty quantity of nft to mint
    */
    modifier isValidAmount(uint256 _nftQty) {
        require(msg.value >= (mintPrice * _nftQty), "Invalid Amount");
        _;
    }
```

The check makes sure that the user sent the ether amount that is equal to or higher than the necessary one. 

```solidity
require(msg.value >= (mintPrice * _nftQty), "Invalid Amount");
```

**Recommendation**

Change the check to make sure the amount sent is exactly equal to the required amount. Making this change will protect the users from making mistakes and sending too much ether into the contract.

### [Some methods should be locked while the sale is active](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/issues/6)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Medium&color=FF9500&style=flat-square)

**Description**

The owner has permission to change some important parameters while the sale is active:

- [`setMaxMintPerAddress`](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/blob/0c7e33d79303b0e0278aa10943580119b08c8778/code/contracts/Land.sol#L358-L370)
- [`ownerMint`](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/blob/0c7e33d79303b0e0278aa10943580119b08c8778/code/contracts/Land.sol#L438-L465)
- [`setMintPrice`](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/blob/0c7e33d79303b0e0278aa10943580119b08c8778/code/contracts/Land.sol#L509-L521)
- [`setMerkleRoot`](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/blob/0c7e33d79303b0e0278aa10943580119b08c8778/code/contracts/Land.sol#L599-L611)

The parameters controlled by these methods are very important for the users. 

A few examples of why these methods should be inactive while the sale is happening:

- owner can change the token price
- owner can change the merkle root
- owner can change the token limit sale per address

The users assume the contract they are interacting with is safe. This includes coding bugs and centralization issues, such as the owner being able to change the price mid-auction or changing the token limit sale.

**Recommendation**

Do not allow the methods to be called while the sale is active.

### [Simplify `withdraw` and `withdrawAll` by sending the funds directly to `withdrawalRecipient`](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/issues/2)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Medium&color=FF9500&style=flat-square)

**Description**


[code/contracts/Land.sol#L249-L260](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/blob/0c7e33d79303b0e0278aa10943580119b08c8778/code/contracts/Land.sol#L249-L260)
```solidity
    /**
    * @dev Throws if withdrawalRecipient is invalid
    *
    * @param _withdrawalRecipient withdrawalRecipient passed by caller
    */
    modifier isValidRecipient(address _withdrawalRecipient) {
        require(
            withdrawalRecipient == _withdrawalRecipient,
            "Invalid Recipient"
        );
        _;
    }
```

There's only 1 valid account that funds can be sent to. Thus, the argument `_withdrawalRecipient` is not required.


[code/contracts/Land.sol#L669](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/blob/0c7e33d79303b0e0278aa10943580119b08c8778/code/contracts/Land.sol#L669)
```solidity
    function withdraw(address _withdrawalRecipient, uint256 _amount)
```


[code/contracts/Land.sol#L669](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/blob/0c7e33d79303b0e0278aa10943580119b08c8778/code/contracts/Land.sol#L669)
```solidity
    function withdraw(address _withdrawalRecipient, uint256 _amount)
```

**Recommendation**

Remove modifiers, send directly to `_withdrawalRecipient`



---


### [Use `uint256` instead of `uint8`](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/issues/5)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Minor](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Minor&color=FFCC00&style=flat-square)

**Description**

**Recommendation**

**[optional] References**


---


### [Modifier `isBalanceEnough` is not needed](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/issues/1)
![Issue status: Open](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Status&message=Open&color=5856D6&style=flat-square) ![Minor](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Severity&message=Minor&color=FFCC00&style=flat-square)

**Description**

This is not needed since the tx will fail anyway if not enough ether is available.


[code/contracts/Land.sol#L262-L270](https://github.com/akiratechhq/review-casinoverse-land-2022-08/blob/0c7e33d79303b0e0278aa10943580119b08c8778/code/contracts/Land.sol#L262-L270)
```solidity
    /**
    * @dev Throws if _amount exceeds contract balance
    *
    * @param _amount amount to withdraw
    */
    modifier isBalanceEnough(uint256 _amount) {
        require(_amount <= address(this).balance, "Not Enough Balance");
        _;
    }
```

**Recommendation**

Remove modifier since this will not change how the contract functions.

Keep the modifier `isBalanceNotZero` since this will not create a "no-operation" transaction that doesn't transfer any ether.
